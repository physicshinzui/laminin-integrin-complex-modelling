# Integrin-laminin Complex modelling

## Outline
1. `01_gen_compl_candidates.py` generates los of PDBs, in which superimposition is carried out according to the C-alpha positions of the gamma tail in both laminin system and integrin-gtail one.

2. `02_calc_violation.py` contains a function that judge if an PDB of the PDBs generated is violated by considering C-alpha distances

FixME:
A problem is the computational expence. 
if it is done, it will take 27 days!!!
